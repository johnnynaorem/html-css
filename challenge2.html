              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had and amazing experience here. I signed up for the free into
              course and found it Incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.

          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
          the aglle team project, In particular, was outdtading. It took my leaning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to to during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
          100% recommended!."
